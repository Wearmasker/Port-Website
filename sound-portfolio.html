        It is my passion and my drive in life to create new audio for stories that are engaging,
        magical, and profound. I want to spark curiosity, for people to say, “Wow, that sounded really cool;
        I wonder how they did that?” My ultimate goal is to enrich your story by providing creative sound
        design and effects through thoughtful, out-of-the-box thinking. Your characters and the adventures
        they embark on should have rich and driven sonic motifs that will add substantial weight and depth
        to any narrative.
